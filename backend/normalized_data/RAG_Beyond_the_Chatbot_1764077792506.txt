Introduction
ChatGPT’s late 2022 launch commanded global attention, demonstrating the potential of combining large
language models (LLMs) with a chat interface to access and interpret vast amounts of data.
Business leaders immediately asked, “How can I have a ChatGPT for my company’s data?”
A popular answer to this question came in the form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a technique
developed years prior by Facebook researchers. RAG extends language models by providing relevant contextual
data from external sources, allowing more accurate, timely, and contextually grounded outputs than possible
relying solely on the language model’s embedded knowledge. This approach also helps address—but doesn’t
eliminate—the challenge of hallucination, where language models generate inaccurate information.
In recent months, many companies have begun building generative AI projects focused on delivering RAG-
based chatbots for internal and external users, often starting with systems to augment traditional knowledge
bases and search engines.
While these efforts are a great step at demonstrating the capability of generative AI, they often stumble due
to the inherent limitations of chatbot interfaces.
This report aims to broaden technology leaders’ perspectives on the opportunities that RAG offers, while
informing their implementation strategies. It explores core concepts, real-world challenges, and high-value
applications beyond simple chatbots.
Before discussing how retrieval-augmented generation works and helping you plan your deployment, let’s first
address the key limitations of chatbots in the enterprise. Doing so will allow us to better appreciate the broader
approach advocated in this report.

Limitations of Chatbots
While ChatGPT’s accessible chatbot interface was a key part of its appeal, dialogue-based interfaces have
inherent weaknesses as enterprise tools. In particular, they often struggle to provide the structured and focused
user experience that business users require for efficient task completion.
By integrating retrieval-augmented generation into established enterprise workflows—rather than delivering
standalone chatbots—organizations can more quickly and effectively leverage its capabilities.
RAG-based systems integrated into enterprise workflows offer several key benefits:
1. Focus: Existing enterprise applications are designed to provide a focused user experience that guides users
through complex tasks with precision. This is contrasted with open-ended chat interfaces that invite frustration
due to lack of direction and mis-set expectations.
2. Structure: Many enterprise tasks revolve around handling discrete data values, such as financial figures,
inventory numbers, customer details, or project milestones. Forcing users to interact with this structured
data through a chat interface can be cumbersome and inefficient.
3. Integration: Integration with enterprise systems ensures that AI models have access to the latest relevant
information for task completion, ensuring well-informed decisions and eliminating manual errors.
4. Familiarity: Employees are already trained on existing enterprise systems. Integrating RAG into familiar
interfaces reduces the learning curve and increases adoption rates compared to introducing a new, standalone
chatbot interface.
5. Contextual Awareness: Enterprise workflows often involve multi-step processes where each step provides
context for the next. RAG integrated into these workflows can leverage and preserve this sequential context
more effectively than a chatbot, which often lacks persistent state or process awareness.
6. Security, Compliance, and Auditability: Enterprise workflows often have built-in security measures, compliance
checks, and auditing capabilities. Integrating RAG into these existing systems leverages established security
protocols, ensuring data protection and regulatory compliance without having to reinvent these for standalone
chatbots.
While chatbots have their place, they often fall short in complex enterprise environments. By integrating RAG
into existing workflows and systems, organizations can take advantage of the technology’s benefits while
maintaining the structure, security, and familiarity that business users require. This approach paves the way
for more effective and widely adopted AI solutions across the enterprise. Before exploring examples of how
RAG can enhance a variety of business processes, let’s review the key concepts underlying this technology.

Core Concepts of RAG Systems
RAG systems consist of two main components, corresponding to the “R” and “G” in RAG:
1. Retrieval system (“R”)
2. Generation system (“G”)
The retrieval system responds to a user query by collecting the most precise and relevant context from the
data store or grounding source. Key aspects include efficient data indexing and storage, and selecting and
ranking the most relevant information.
The generation system, a large language model, takes the context returned by the retrieval system and, along
with the user’s prompt, uses it to generate a response to the user. It interprets and weaves the retrieved data
into meaningful, coherent language.
The Importance of Balanced Focus
Early adopters often overemphasize RAG’s “G” (generation) and neglect its “R” (retrieval). This imbalance can
lead to a “garbage in, garbage out” scenario. No matter how sophisticated the LLM, if it’s working with irrelevant
or low-quality data, the responses will be subpar.
Retrieval is a complex problem that requires significant attention to ensure the language model gets high-
quality, relevant data. Fortunately, we have decades of experience in information retrieval and search systems.
It still requires substantial effort and discipline, particularly around evaluation metrics and systems, to deliver
RAG-based products that users find genuinely helpful.
Retrieval Mechanisms
RAG doesn’t specify a particular retrieval mechanism. Any method returning relevant context may be used.
Popular approaches include:
1. Vector search: Converting text and other data types (images, audio files, etc.) into sequences of numbers,
or “vectors,” has been fundamental in computational sciences for over 50 years. Storing and querying these
vectors in purpose-built databases grew in popularity in the 00s for semantic search applications and
recommendation systems. Maturing just in time for use with LLMs, vector search systems have gained
popularity in RAG implementations due to their ability to efficiently perform similarity search, which enables
retrieving context that is relevant to the user’s query based on meaning, rather than exact keyword matches.

2. Traditional text-based search: Despite the popularity of vector-based approaches, many modern RAG
systems incorporate text- or keyword-based search to address the shortcomings of pure vector search,
such as dealing with precisely worded queries, or rare or uncommon terms.
3. Advanced approaches: Emerging hybrid systems combine vector and text-based retrieval methods to
leverage the strengths of each. Metadata-based filtering can be used to ensure only relevant context is
selected. In two-stage systems a reranker provides a second stage of retrieval to identify the most relevant
documents. Graph-based approaches use knowledge graphs to capture relationships between entities,
enhancing contextual relevance.
Vector Embeddings: A Brief Explanation
If a vector represents text as a sequence of numbers, a vector embedding does so while preserving their
meanings relative to one another.
A vector search system is one in which:
• Documents or text chunks are converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings.
• Queries are also converted to vectors.
• Similarity between query and document vectors is used to retrieve relevant information.
Canonical RAG System Pipeline
A typical retrieval-augmented generation system operates as follows:
1. Data preparation:
• Collect the data for your context.
• Chunk it into appropriately sized segments for your application.
• Tag the chunks with metadata to aid in later retrieval.
• Embed the chunks and store the embeddings in a vector database.
2. Data retrieval
• Embed the user query.
• Search the vector database for similar embeddings.
• Retrieve the nearest-neighbor chunks.
3. Response generation
• Add those chunks to a prompt for generating the response.
• Perform an LLM inference or API call with this prompt.
• Return the generated response to the user.
This workflow shows how the retrieval and generation components work together to provide contextually
relevant responses based on your data.
By understanding these core concepts and the interplay between retrieval and generation, organizations can
design and implement effective RAG systems for a variety of enterprise use cases.

RAG Beyond the Chatbot: Use Cases
While chatbots are the prototypical RAG application, the technology’s potential extends beyond conversational
interfaces. RAG’s ability to synthesize relevant business information opens up a wide array of enterprise
applications.
This section explores diverse RAG use cases able to drive significant business value. By examining these
examples, technology leaders can gain a broader perspective on applying RAG within their organizations to
improve efficiency and drive innovation. Let’s explore ways to deploy retrieval-augmented generation for
business impact:
Code Generation
Though not typically considered a RAG application, code generation exemplifies RAG in action, where the
retrieval context is the existing codebase and the generated content is code.
Code generation illustrates the importance of use-case-appropriate retrieval mechanisms. Unlike general RAG
applications, code generation employs a combination of vector- and heuristics-based retrieval methods. For
instance, GitHub Copilot utilizes an algorithm that emphasizes open tabs when prompting the language model
for code completion.
This approach also demonstrates how RAG can be adapted to specific domains, leveraging contextual
information (the developer’s current focus) for more relevant suggestions. By prioritizing open tabs, the system
can offer code completions that better align with the developer’s task or thought process.
The evolution of code generation tools reinforces our thesis about workflow integration. While developers
initially experimented with code generation through ChatGPT’s interface, the technology’s true potential
emerged when tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor embedded these capabilities directly into IDEs. This mirrors
our broader argument: the greatest business value comes from integrating AI capabilities into existing tools
and processes, not from standalone interfaces.
Document Generation
Content creation is a fundamental application of generative AI. By leveraging RAG, organizations can infuse
core document generation processes with business-specific context, ensuring more accurate and relevant
outputs.

New York based Scalestack markets itself as an “AI-powered,
enterprise-grade go-to-market (GTM) orchestration &
activation platform.” The Scalestack platform provides
automated workflows that allow customer sales teams to
clean, enrich and prioritize account data at scale, resulting
in more complete buyer profiles, a greater ability to predict
buying behavior, and a data-based way to prioritize sales
and marketing efforts. Ultimately this reduces the amount
of time sales reps spend researching prospects and increases
their ability to focus on the right accounts at the right time.
Scalestack collaborated with MongoDB in March 2023 to
develop Spotlight v1, an AI copilot for sales representatives.
The initial user experience featured a chatGPT-inspired UI
that displayed prioritized accounts with AI-generated
insights. However, Scalestack soon discovered that sales
representatives were reluctant to adopt another user
interface, necessitating a crucial pivot in their approach.
Responding to user feedback, Scalestack shifted focus to
integrating their AI capabilities into existing workflows and
familiar tools. The result was a workflow builder that
empowers users to create automated sequences for routine
tasks without manual intervention. The insights generated
by these RAG-based workflows can then be incorporated
into the tools—like CRM systems—that its users and their
managers already use.
Technical Implementation
Scalestack RAG implementation demonstrates sophisticated
use of diverse data sources and advanced AI techniques.
The company leverages MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for
efficient data management and retrieval. This choice allows
Scalestack to handle a wide range of data types with a
flexible schema and powerful querying abilities over large
datasets.
The company’s RAG modules retrieve information from
various sources, including:
• Customer-provided documents
• SEC reports
• Crawled websites
• API query results
Atlas Vector Search enables Scalestack RAG system to
incorporate the most relevant company data from these
sources, leading to dynamic, informative responses.
Scalestack implemented a comprehensive system for
evaluation in order to maintain data quality and improve
RAG performance:
1. Tracing and Logging: Each AI and machine learning call
is traced and saved with input, output, and (for LLMs or
agents) prompts and tools used.
2. Continuous Improvement: The company implemented
a feedback loop that strongly prioritizes direct feedback
from users. Any generated content that doesn’t satisfy
users is added to a test dataset and prompts and other
aspects of the system are iterated on until the exact data
that the client needs is produced.
3. Testing Dataset: A portion of queries, including traces
receiving negative feedback, is automatically saved in a
testing dataset. This dataset undergoes multiple checks,
including:
• AI checks (using an LLM as the evaluator)
• Rule-based checks
• RAG output checks
• Human review
Testing and evaluation continue until the testing dataset
passes all checks, aiming for a minimum of 99% accuracy
in quality.
Impact
Scalestack’s journey illustrates the power of integrating
RAG directly into existing workflows. By pivoting from a
standalone chatbot interface to an embedded solution, the
company not only improved the value delivered to end users,
but also enhanced the overall efficiency of their customers’
sales processes. Their meticulous approach to data quality
and continuous improvement demonstrates how RAG can
be effectively implemented and refined in a real-world
business context. This case study underscores a key theme
of this report: the most impactful RAG implementations
often augment familiar tools and processes to deliver
tangible business value.
